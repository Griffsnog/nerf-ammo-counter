/*Here's how it will work:
 * It's simple. When the trigger is pulled, count down 1 from the ammo. When a magazine is inserted, refill the ammo. A button can be 
 * used to toggle through the different magazine sizes: 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, and 36. The last mode is counts up, starting from 0, 
 * which can be accessed from the toggling the magazine sizes. The magazine sizes will increment, with the press of the button, from 0, 
 * 5, 6, 12 â€¦ 36 and will not decrement, for the sake of simplicity.  
 * 
 * 
 * I am aware that the code isn't that good. It's not my best, not my neatest, and it's not too efficient for working with micro controllers, but it should be fine.

//If I want to access the value 1, which is the first value of the array/list, which the computer sees as the
